* Classification    General Business Information
* Brief             MPC5744P CLKOUT. PLL Configured to 160 MHz
********************************************************************************
* Detailed Description:
* Configures MPC5744P CLKOUT signal and PLL to 160 MHz.
* This code example divides PLL by 10 for output frequency of 16 MHz.
* Configures MPC5744P CLKOUT signal to 16 MHz. Connect to LED so LED
* flashes at frequency of CLKOUT. Onboard red RGB turns on to let user
* know program is running, but does not flash.
*
* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Test HW:         DEVKIT-MPC5744P
* MCU:             MPC5744P
* Terminal:        None
* Fsys:            160 MHz PLL on 40MHz external oscillator
* Debugger:        OpenSDA
* Target:          FLASH
* EVB connection:  Connect CLKOUT (PB6 - J1_16) to oscilloscope or any external component
* 					such as an external LED. Onboard RGB LED does not support external connection.
* 					If external LED used, connect one end to J1_16 and the other to GND (J2_13),
* 					in series with current-limiting resistor (typically 330 ohm).  The external LED will
* 					flash at the CLKOUT frequency but if frequency is fast, the naked eye
* 					will perceive the flash as a PWM, meaning the LED will be seen as on
* 					at a certain brightness.
