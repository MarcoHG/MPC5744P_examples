********************************************************************************
* Detailed Description:
* This code example simulates faults with the FCCU. Press SW1 to simulate the fault.
* When FAULT status is detected, the MCU system moves into SAFE mode and flashes the
* red LED.  Press SW2 to clear the fault. Red LED will turn back off.
